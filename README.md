# Appolina- School project
This project is about gym, it shows gym exercises, simple html, css and js page.
We didn't use any js framework, because it wasn't necessary- We had to apply custom cursor, custom navbar, sounds after clicking a button, and some animations after hover on elements, in this case hover on images.
